The Smbhav Anthem
01/03
A captivating musical performance by Tushar Lall and The India Jam Project reimagined sounds from Amazon India’s universe, weaving them into a performance track that acted as the catalyst for the Smbhav anthem.


The Smbhav film used the Unreal Engine to blend real-life footage with a virtual camera, allowing for some impressive scene changes and movements in fictional settings. A 10-year-old playing hopscotch became a metaphor for Amazon’s journey in India.
